A retried request must not produce a second charge, a second subscription, or a second refund.
Payable guards mutating operations with an idempotency layer: it resolves a stable key for the
operation, hashes the request, and either replays the stored response, blocks a concurrent run, or
runs the operation once and caches the result. The same key reused with a *different* request body
is rejected as a conflict.

## Configuration

Idempotency is configured through `IdempotencyConfig` on `PayableConfig`
(`src/support/config/payable-config.ts`):

```ts
export type IdempotencyStrategy = 'auto' | 'manual';

export interface IdempotencyConfig {
  enabled?: boolean;
  strategy?: IdempotencyStrategy;
  store?: IdempotencyStore;
}
```

`enabled` defaults to `true` and `strategy` defaults to `auto`. A configured `store` supplies the
engine record used for request hashing, concurrency control, replay, and failure state.

### Configuration behavior

- `auto` wires the configured store into operations that derive their own keys. An explicit catalog
  key also uses that store.
- `manual` leaves existing non-catalog key handling manual. An explicit catalog key still uses the
  configured store.
- `enabled: false` prevents Payable from creating an engine idempotency service, even when a store
  is present. A keyed catalog mutation can then use provider-native protection only.

Catalog behavior depends on whether a caller key, an engine store, and provider-native catalog
idempotency are available. See [Catalog mutation idempotency](#catalog-mutation-idempotency).

## Non-catalog key resolution

Some non-catalog actions use `ResolveIdempotencyKeyAction` to select an explicit key, then an entity
resolver, then `DefaultIdempotencyKeyResolver`:

```ts
const resolved =
  input.explicitKey ??
  input.entityResolver?.resolve(input.context) ??
  input.globalResolver?.resolve(input.context) ??
  this.fallback.resolve(input.context);
return IdempotencyKey.of(resolved);
```

The configuration has no resolver field. Action callers may still supply `globalResolver`
programmatically. A resolver may return `null`, which falls through to the next source and then the
deterministic default.

### DefaultIdempotencyKeyResolver

`src/application/services/idempotency/default-idempotency-key-resolver.ts` builds a deterministic
colon-delimited key, filling absent parts with `na`:

```ts
resolve(context: IdempotencyKeyResolverContext): string {
  return ['op', context.operation, context.provider ?? 'na',
    context.resourceType ?? 'na', context.resourceId ?? 'na'].join(':');
}
```

So `{ operation: 'charge', provider: 'stripe', resourceType: 'User', resourceId: '1' }` yields
`op:charge:stripe:User:1`, and `{ operation: 'charge' }` yields `op:charge:na:na:na`.

### Typed operation keys

`IdempotencyKey` (`src/domain/value-objects/idempotency-key.ts`) also offers typed factories for the
core operations, each URL-encoding its segments:

- `forCheckout` → `checkout:<provider>:<billableType>:<billableId>:<price>:<subscriptionName>`
- `forCharge` → `charge:<provider>:<billableType>:<billableId>:<reference>:<amount>:<currency>`
- `forSubscription` → `subscription:<provider>:<billableType>:<billableId>:<subscriptionName>:<price>`
- `forRefund` → `refund:<provider>:<paymentId>:<amount>:<currency>`
- `forWebhook` → `webhook:<provider>:<providerEventId>`

`IdempotencyKey.of('')` throws - an empty key is never valid.

## Request hashing

The key answers *"is this the same logical operation?"*; the request hash answers *"is this the same
request body?"*. `hashRequest` (`src/support/hash/request-hash.ts`) canonicalizes the request before
digesting so that key order and `undefined` fields do not change the hash:

```ts
function canonicalize(value: unknown): string {
  if (value === null || typeof value !== 'object') return JSON.stringify(value) ?? 'null';
  if (Array.isArray(value)) return `[${value.map(canonicalize).join(',')}]`;
  const entries = Object.entries(value as Record<string, unknown>)
    .filter(([, v]) => v !== undefined)
    .sort(([a], [b]) => a.localeCompare(b));
  return `{${entries.map(([k, v]) => `${JSON.stringify(k)}:${canonicalize(v)}`).join(',')}}`;
}
```

The canonical string is SHA-256 hashed via `crypto.subtle.digest` and rendered as hex.

## The store

`IdempotencyStore` (`src/domain/contracts/idempotency-store.contract.ts`) persists one
`IdempotencyRecord` per key:

```ts
export interface IdempotencyStore {
  find(key, tenantId?): Promise<IdempotencyRecord | null>;
  acquire(record, tenantId?): Promise<boolean>;
  takeOver(record, tenantId?): Promise<boolean>;
  put(record, tenantId?): Promise<void>;
  markCompleted(key, response, tenantId?, lockToken?, expiresAt?): Promise<void>;
  markFailed(key, tenantId?, lockToken?, expiresAt?): Promise<void>;
}
```

A record has `status` of `processing | completed | failed | expired`, the `requestHash`, the cached
`response`, a `lockedUntil` lock expiry, and an optional `expiresAt`.

## Execution flow

`IdempotencyService` (`src/application/services/idempotency/idempotency-service.ts`) ties it
together. Service options: `lockTtlMs` (default `30_000`), `retryFailed` (default `true`),
`completedTtlMs` (default `86_400_000`), and `failedTtlMs` (default = `lockTtlMs`).

By default, store operations use the scoped key `${scope}:${key}`. An execution can supply a
fixed-length storage identity when its accepted caller key could exceed a database key column after
scoping. Tenant scope remains a separate store argument. Generic operations that omit this identity
retain the existing scoped-key behavior.

### Read, acquire, and replay

The service hashes the request, resolves the execution policy, and reads the scoped record. An
unexpired record with another request hash raises `IdempotencyConflictError`. A completed record
replays its stored response without calling `run`. When the execution supplies `revive`, replay passes
the stored response through that function first, which reconstructs values such as `Money` after a
database serialization round trip.

A processing record carries a random `lockToken` and `lockedUntil`. The token fences completion and
failure writes so a previous lease owner cannot overwrite a newer result. A held lease raises
`IdempotencyInProgressError`. When acquisition loses a race, the service reads the scoped record
again and replays a completed winner when available. Expired records are eligible for `takeOver`.
Failed records are eligible for `takeOver` only when the retry policy permits a retry. Stale processing
records are eligible for `takeOver` only when the active reclaim policy permits it. In this takeover
path, `IdempotencyInProgressError` is returned only when `takeOver` does not claim the record.

The default policy uses `lockTtlMs`, the configured retry behavior, and `failedTtlMs`. It does not
reclaim stale processing records unless the execution opts in. The `reconciliation-required` failure
policy disables failed-record retries, enables stale takeover after the lease, and uses
`completedTtlMs` for both its processing lease and failed-record expiry. Until that expiry, a retry of
a failed record returns `IdempotencyReconciliationRequiredError`.

### Completion verification

After `run` returns, the service asks the store to `markCompleted` with the scoped key, response,
tenant, `lockToken`, and `expiresAt = now + completedTtlMs`. It reads the scoped record after
`markCompleted` whether that write resolves or throws. This read detects a silent zero-row update and
recovers when the store persisted the completion before reporting an acknowledgement error.

A completed record with the same request hash is authoritative. The service returns the local result
only when `markCompleted` resolved and the stored `lockToken` belongs to the current execution. If a
different lock token won, or completion acknowledgement was lost, it returns the authoritative stored
response through `revive`. This prevents a stale executor from returning its superseded result.

If the completion cannot be verified, the service attempts a fenced `markFailed` and raises
`IdempotencyResultPersistenceError` with the caller key and correlation ID. A cleanup failure cannot
hide that error. When `run` itself throws, the service marks the scoped record failed under the same
lock token and rethrows the original operation error.

## Catalog mutation idempotency

Product and price writes accept `CatalogMutationOptions`:

```ts
interface CatalogMutationOptions {
  authorization?: AuthorizationContext;
  idempotencyKey?: string;
}

await payable.providerCatalog('stripe-primary', 'tenant-acme').products.create(
  { name: 'Pro' },
  { idempotencyKey: 'catalog-product-pro-v1' },
);
```

The option applies to product create, update, activate, and archive operations, and to price create,
activate, and archive operations. A caller key must contain 1 through 255 Unicode scalar values. It
cannot be blank, start or end with whitespace, or contain an unpaired surrogate. Treat it as opaque
and avoid customer identifiers or other sensitive data.

Omitting the key preserves provider and persistence behavior without catalog idempotency. Reuse the
same key only to retry the same request. The engine rejects the same key with a different request as
`IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. A new key represents a new intentional operation.

### Effective identity and provider key

The effective identity combines four dimensions: tenant scope, registered provider, catalog
operation, and caller key. The same caller key can therefore identify independent operations across
tenants, provider registrations, or actions such as `product.create` and `product.update`.

For a provider that declares `catalogIdempotency`, Payable derives this provider-safe key:

```text
payable:catalog:v1:<lowercase SHA-256 hex digest>
```

The digest covers the version tag, tagged tenant scope, registered provider, catalog operation, and
caller key. The raw caller key is never forwarded to the provider. This prevents one tenant,
provider registration, or operation from sharing the provider key of another.

The engine store uses the same fixed-length derived identity as its persisted key. This keeps every
valid 255-scalar caller key within the storage schema limit while retaining tenant, provider,
operation, and caller-key isolation. Generic idempotency operations keep their existing scoped keys.

### Execution matrix

| Caller key | Engine store | Provider capability | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| absent | any | any | Run without catalog idempotency. |
| present | configured | `catalogIdempotency` | Deduplicate in the engine and send the derived key to the provider. |
| present | configured | absent | Deduplicate in the engine and require reconciliation after an ambiguous failure. |
| present | unavailable | `catalogIdempotency` | Send only the derived provider key. |
| present | unavailable | absent | Fail before the provider with `CATALOG_IDEMPOTENCY_STORAGE_REQUIRED`. |

The engine marks a catalog operation complete only after the provider mutation and durable local
catalog persistence both succeed. If it cannot verify the completed record, it returns
`IDEMPOTENCY_RESULT_PERSISTENCE_FAILED`. Authorization and capability checks run before any stored
response can be replayed.

For a provider without native catalog idempotency, an ambiguous mutation failure marks the operation
for reconciliation. A retry with the same key returns `IDEMPOTENCY_RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED` instead
of calling the provider again. List or retrieve the catalog entity, determine whether the first
request succeeded, repair local state when required, then use a new key only for a new intentional
operation.

Idempotency is not a distributed transaction. It reduces duplicate execution, but it cannot make a
remote provider mutation and local database commit atomic. Preserve correlation IDs and reconcile
remote and local state whenever an outcome is uncertain.

## Wiring an operation through it

`ExecuteIdempotentOperationAction`
(`src/application/actions/idempotency/execute-idempotent-operation.action.ts`) resolves the key and
delegates to the service:

```ts
const key = this.resolver.handle({
  explicitKey: input.explicitKey,
  context: input.context,
  entityResolver: input.entityResolver,
  globalResolver: input.globalResolver,
});
return this.service.execute({
  key: key.toString(),
  scope: input.scope,
  operation: input.context.operation,
  request: input.request,
  resourceType: input.context.resourceType ?? null,
  resourceId: input.context.resourceId ?? null,
  tenantId: input.tenantId,
  run: input.run,
});
```

## Example

The operation runs once and the second call replays the cached response:

```ts
const service = new IdempotencyService(new InMemoryIdempotencyStore(), new FakeClock());
let runs = 0;
const request = { amount: 9900, currency: 'USD' };
const run = async () => { runs += 1; return { paymentId: 'pay_1' }; };

const first = await service.execute({ key: 'charge:1', scope: 'charge', operation: 'charge', request, run });
const second = await service.execute({ key: 'charge:1', scope: 'charge', operation: 'charge', request, run });

// first === second === { paymentId: 'pay_1' }, runs === 1
```

Reusing `charge:2` with a different body throws `IdempotencyConflictError`.
