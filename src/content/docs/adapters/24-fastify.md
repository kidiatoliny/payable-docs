`@akira-io/payable/fastify` exposes `createFastifyPayablePlugin(payable, options?)`, which returns a
`FastifyPluginAsync`. Register it on a Fastify instance, optionally under a route prefix.

## Purpose

Bridge Fastify requests to the `Payable` facade and `PayableError` instances to HTTP replies. The
plugin sets a Fastify error handler and registers the webhook routes inside an isolated scope so it
can swap the content-type parser without affecting the rest of the application.

The plugin does not register a generic audit-write route. Authenticate and authorize host domain
operations in the application, then call `payable.audit(tenantId)` directly. See
[Custom domain audit](/examples/46-custom-domain-audit/).

## API

```ts
function createFastifyPayablePlugin(
  payable: Payable,
  options?: FastifyPayableOptions,
): FastifyPluginAsync;

interface FastifyPayableOptions {
  webhookSignatureHeader?: string; // default: 'stripe-signature'
  authenticate?: onRequestHookHandler;
  resolveTenant?: (request: FastifyRequest) => string | null | undefined;
  resolveAuthorization?: (request: FastifyRequest) => AuthorizationContext | undefined;
  rateLimit?: RateLimitPluginOptions;
}
```

The plugin performs, in order:

1. `fastify.setErrorHandler(payableErrorReply)`.
2. Registers `@fastify/rate-limit` with the plugin defaults, merging `options.rateLimit` over them.
3. Registers webhook routes inside a nested `fastify.register(...)` scope.
4. Registers checkout, subscription, refund, customer, read (invoices/payments/subscriptions/refunds),
   and catalog (products/prices) routes inside an authenticated scope. When `options.authenticate` is
   set, it is added as an `onRequest` hook on that scope.

### Canonical collection routes

Fastify exposes the same provider-neutral storage routes as Express:

| Resource | Page route | Exact route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customers | `GET /canonical/customers` | `GET /canonical/customers/:id` |
| Products | `GET /canonical/products` | `GET /canonical/products/:id` |
| Prices | `GET /canonical/prices` | `GET /canonical/prices/:id` |
| Subscriptions | `GET /canonical/subscriptions` | `GET /canonical/subscriptions/:id` |
| Payments | `GET /canonical/payments` | `GET /canonical/payments/:id` |

Page responses use `{ items, nextCursor, hasMore }`, default to 25 items, and accept at most 100.
These routes use the request tenant and never resolve a payment provider. The unprefixed catalogue
routes remain provider-native, while unprefixed subscription and payment reads preserve their
existing array contract.

### Canonical subscription price migration routes

Fastify exposes the same six routes and provider-neutral DTOs as Express:

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| POST | `/canonical/subscription-price-migrations` |
| GET | `/canonical/subscription-price-migrations` |
| GET | `/canonical/subscription-price-migrations/:id` |
| POST | `/canonical/subscription-price-migrations/:id/approve` |
| POST | `/canonical/subscription-price-migrations/:id/cancel` |
| POST | `/canonical/subscription-price-migrations/:id/retry` |

The create body requires canonical subscription and target-price IDs, explicit timing and policies,
and rejects unknown keys. Scheduled requests require an RFC 3339 `effectiveAt`; immediate and
next-renewal requests reject it. Every POST requires one `Idempotency-Key` header. All routes require
a non-empty resolved tenant and a matching allowed authorization context.

Mutation routes use Fastify's 64 KiB body limit and route rate-limit configuration. Pages accept
limits from 1 through 100 and an opaque cursor. Responses exclude provider identifiers, execution
tokens, request hashes, internal execution evidence, and stored provider diagnostics. Automatic
execution and due-page work remain core resource operations and are not HTTP routes.

## Parity with Express

This adapter exposes the same route set as Express: webhooks, checkout, subscription management
(`cancel`, `cancel-now`, `resume`, `swap`), subscription reads, customers, invoices, payments,
products, prices, refunds (create and list), and canonical subscription price migrations.

Every JSON route parses its body or query with the shared Zod schemas in
`src/presentation/shared/schemas.ts` via `parseBody`, so a malformed body is rejected with
`VALIDATION_FAILED` (HTTP 422), the same as Express. List endpoints that accept a `limit` cap it at
`MAX_LIST_LIMIT = 100`; a larger value fails validation with `VALIDATION_FAILED` (422).

Catalog lists accept an opaque `cursor`, default to `active=true`, and return
`{ data, nextCursor }`. Product lists accept `limit`, `cursor`, and `active`; price lists also accept
`providerProductId`. The plugin exposes activation and archival instead of product or price delete
routes. Changing price monetary terms requires creating a replacement price.

## Raw-body handling for webhooks

The webhook routes are registered inside a dedicated `fastify.register(...)` scope. Within that
scope, the plugin removes all content-type parsers and installs a single buffer parser, so the
webhook handler receives the raw request `Buffer`:

```ts
scope.removeAllContentTypeParsers();
scope.addContentTypeParser('*', { parseAs: 'buffer' }, (_request, body, done) => {
  done(null, body);
});
```

Because this is done inside an isolated scope, the buffer parser applies only to the webhook routes;
checkout and subscription routes keep Fastify's default JSON parsing. The handler converts the
buffer to a UTF-8 string (or an empty string if it is not a buffer) and forwards payload, signature
(from `options.webhookSignatureHeader`, default `stripe-signature`), and flattened headers to
`payable.receiveWebhook(...)`.

## Rate limiting

The plugin registers `@fastify/rate-limit` before any routes, with these defaults:

```ts
await fastify.register(rateLimit, {
  global: false,
  max: 100,
  timeWindow: '1 minute',
  ...options.rateLimit,
});
```

| Default | Value | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `global` | `false` | The limiter is opt-in per route, not applied to every route automatically. |
| `max` | `100` | Maximum requests per `timeWindow` for routes that enable the limiter. |
| `timeWindow` | `'1 minute'` | The rolling window the `max` count applies over. |

Pass `options.rateLimit` (typed `RateLimitPluginOptions` from `@fastify/rate-limit`) to override or
extend any of these; the supplied object is spread over the defaults, so it wins on conflicts.

`@fastify/rate-limit` (`>=9`) is declared an **optional peer**. It is imported and registered
unconditionally by the plugin, so it must be installed for the Fastify adapter to load - install it
alongside `fastify` when using this adapter.

## Error mapping

`payableErrorReply` is set as Fastify's error handler and delegates to the shared mappers:

```ts
export function payableErrorReply(error, _request, reply): void {
  reply.status(payableErrorStatus(error)).send(payableErrorBody(error));
}
```

Status and body follow the same `STATUS_BY_CODE` table and `{ error, message }` shape documented in
`docs/adapters/23-express.md`. `INVALID_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE` maps to 400 and `VALIDATION_FAILED` to 422.

## Authentication and catalog authorization

As with Express, the plugin installs no authentication middleware. Checkout and legacy subscription
routes are unprotected; webhook routes are protected only by provider signature verification. The
caller must authenticate the request and verify ownership of the billable. Canonical subscription
price migration routes also fail closed unless `resolveTenant` and `resolveAuthorization`
return a matching tenant and allowed actor. See `docs/28-security.md`.

Use the `authenticate` hook to establish the caller before a catalog route runs. For each catalog
mutation, `resolveAuthorization` runs once and returns an `AuthorizationContext` from that trusted
identity. Fastify forwards the object unchanged in `CatalogMutationOptions`; the core resource makes
the final authorization decision. A denied catalog write returns `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` before
capability validation or provider calls.

## Catalog idempotency

Product and price mutation routes accept one `Idempotency-Key` header. Fastify validates it and
forwards the value as `CatalogMutationOptions.idempotencyKey`. Invalid or duplicate header lines
return `INVALID_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY` with HTTP 400.

```bash
curl -X POST https://example.test/products \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: catalog-product-pro-v1' \
  -d '{"name":"Pro"}'
```

Reuse the value for the same tenant, provider, catalog operation, and body. The shared error mapper
returns `IDEMPOTENCY_RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED` as HTTP 409 and
`CATALOG_IDEMPOTENCY_STORAGE_REQUIRED` as HTTP 500. See
[Idempotency](/features/14-idempotency/) for recovery guidance.

## Registration example

```ts
import Fastify from 'fastify';
import { createPayable } from '@akira-io/payable';
import { createFastifyPayablePlugin } from '@akira-io/payable/fastify';

const payable = createPayable({ providers: { stripe: stripeProvider }, storage });

const app = Fastify();
await app.register(createFastifyPayablePlugin(payable), { prefix: '/billing' });
await app.ready();
```

With catalog authorization enabled:

```ts
await app.register(
  createFastifyPayablePlugin(payable, {
    authenticate: requireApiKey,
    resolveAuthorization: (request) => ({
      allowed: true,
      actorId: request.user.id,
      tenantId: request.user.tenantId,
    }),
  }),
  { prefix: '/billing' },
);
```

With a custom signature header:

```ts
await app.register(
  createFastifyPayablePlugin(payable, { webhookSignatureHeader: 'paddle-signature' }),
  { prefix: '/billing' },
);
```

The `prefix` option is Fastify's standard register option; all routes above are mounted beneath it
(for example `POST /billing/webhooks`).

## Edge cases

- Multiple registered providers with no `:provider` segment surface `WEBHOOK_PROVIDER_AMBIGUOUS`
  (400) from the facade.
- Webhook receipt requires a storage driver (`WEBHOOK_STORAGE_REQUIRED`, 500, when absent).
- `GET /subscriptions/:name` returns 404 when the named subscription does not exist.
